# Approved Outside of Computer Science Department Electives

Although usually a case-by-case based approval system that must be passed through the current Department of Undergraduate Study (DUS), students are occasionally allowed to count certain courses not in the CS department towards their CS Advanced Electives. Here are a list of courses that, according to 2018 DUS Professor Yang have (and have not) been approved. 

**Approved**

ECON 413
EENG 437
LING 225
LING 229
LING 380
MB&B 452
PHIL 427
S&DS 352
S&DS 365
S&DS 468
S&DS 669

**Not Approved**

MGT  656/650
MENG 400
S&DS 361

Another thing to note is that usually the department will only approve one outside elective per student. These particular classes are also only the case for the pure CS major, and may change for students majoring in one of the dual majors such as CS and Math or Computing and the Arts.
